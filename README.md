Improved Import on Magento Connect

Improved Import extension enhance the ability of default Magento import process with adding the most requested features! All this features works with default Magento Dataflow import/export from .csv files. We provide detailed manual and .csv samples for make you life easy! This extension can be very helpful for product migration from another E-Commerce systems to Magento. This extension can be also used for update already exist products with multiple images, additional images from URL, custom options and tier prices!

Import multiple product images


By default you can import only tree types of product images - image, small_image and thumbnail. This is sad, because usually each product on you store can have much more images, photos etc. With Improved Import you can import as many images as you want for each product! Just create additional column on you .csv file and put image names separated by ";" (like "image1.jpg;image2.jpg;image3.jpg") - all images must be uploaded to you media/import folder on this case.

Import multiple product images from external URL


Allow product images import from external URLs, this mean instead of copy product images to media/import folder for import you can just use external URLs from another sites or image storages on you csv file (like "http://sample.com/image.jpg"). External images can be used as main product images (image, small_image and thumbnail) and also you can add additional column to you csv file for import multiple images from external URLs same as images what be uploaded to you server!

Import product custom options


By default in Magento you can import only product attributes but not product custom options, this is can be very big problem add custom options manual in admin for each product. With improved import you can add column on you csv file for import and create product custom options with parameters like option name, type, values etc. This is very easy and flexible method for mass product custom options import and creation.

Import product tier prices


This feature allow you import different product prices for different customers groups on you Magento store. Just add new column on you csv for each customer group. Also you can setup minimum products qty what must be purchased for get special group price.

Import customers with unencrypted passwords


Magento use one side encryption for save customers passwords, this mean you need use hashed passwords in customers import progress, it's not problem when you import customers from another Magento store but if you have you customers passwords without hashing you not have possibility to import it in Magento. This feature resolve this problem, now you can just put unhashed customer passwords on special csv column on import progress.

# Import multiple product images

External images can be used as main product images (image, small_image and thumbnail) and also you can add additional column to you csv file for import multiple images from external URLs same as images what be uploaded to you server!

# Import product custom options


By default in Magento you can import only product attributes but not product custom options, this is can be very big problem add custom options manual in admin for each product.

This feature resolve this problem, now you can just put unhashed customer passwords on special csv column on import progress.
